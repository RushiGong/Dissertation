## Abstract

Understanding atomic environments is essential for optimizing the performance and properties of materials by providing insights into structure-property relationships. CALPHAD modeling, which describes the Gibbs energies of individual phases, is a key tool for describing multi-component thermodynamics. For complex multi-component solution phases, advanced thermodynamic models are required to capture the inherent complexities of atomic environments in the phase, such as short-range ordering. A significant challenge in CALPHAD modeling is comparing various thermodynamic models and selecting the most appropriate one for each phase. Open-source software tools, PyCalphad and ESPEI, have enabled high-throughput CALPHAD modeling with uncertainty quantification. The integration of Bayesian parameter estimation within the Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach in ESPEI facilitates Bayesian model selection in CALPHAD modeling. 

This dissertation will discuss the selection and statistical comparison of thermodynamic models for describing atomic environments in materials, focusing on intermetallic catalysts and molten salts. Employing a four-sublattice model for the Pd-Zn-based $\gamma$-brass phase successfully predicts the site occupancy of active metals within intermetallic structures. This atomic control of active-site ensembles in Pd-Zn-based $\gamma$-brass intermetallics allows for the precise tailoring of activity and selectivity in hydrogenation reactions. For complex molten salts, candidate models such as the associate model, two-sublattice ionic model, and modified quasichemical model with quadruplets approximation are considered to describe short-range ordering. Bayesian statistics are applied to compare these models and identify the most favorable one for molten salt liquids, further enhancing the accuracy of predictive modeling of critical characteristics. Additionally, a template generator has been developed to allow users to customize thermodynamic models within PyCalphad. These advancements provide the community with extensive opportunities to comprehensively evaluate thermodynamic modeling with uncertainty quantification and model selection, accelerating the optimization process in data-driven materials design and discovery.
