\section{Revisiting thermodynamics in (LiF, NaF, KF, CrF${_2}$)-CrF${_3}$ by first-principles calculations and CALPHAD modeling } \label{moltensalts:sec:FLiNaKCr}
The thermodynamic description of the (LiF, NaF, KF, CrF$_2$)-CrF$_3$ systems has been revisited, aiming for a better understanding of the effects of Cr on the FLiNaK molten salt. First-principles calculations based on DFT were performed to determine the electronic and structural properties of each compound, including the formation enthalpy, volume, and bulk modulus. DFT-based phonon calculations were carried out to determine the thermodynamic properties of compounds, for example, enthalpy, entropy, and heat capacity as functions of temperature. Phonon-based thermodynamic properties show a good agreement with experimental data of binary compounds LiF, NaF, KF, CrF$_3$, and CrF$_2$, establishing a solid foundation to determine thermodynamic properties of ternary compounds as well as to verify results estimated by the Neumann-Kopp rule. Additionally, DFT-based AIMD simulations were employed to predict the mixing enthalpies of liquid salts. Using DFT-based results and experimental data in the literature, the (LiF, NaF, KF, CrF$_2$)-CrF$_3$ system has been remodeled in terms of the CALPHAD approach using the MQMQA for liquid. Calculated phase stability in the present work shows an excellent agreement with experiments, indicating the effectiveness of combining DFT-based total energy, phonon, and AIMD calculations, and CALPHAD modeling to provide the thermodynamic description in complex molten salt systems.

\subsection{Modeling details} \label{moltensalts:ssec:FLiNaKCrmodel}
%%% Compounds information
The (LiF, NaF, KF, CrF$_2$)-CrF$_3$ system includes five binary (endmember) compounds, i.e., LiF, NaF, KF, CrF$_3$ and CrF$_2$, and eight ternary (intermetallic) compounds, i.e., Li$_3$CrF$_6$, Na$_3$CrF$_6$, Na$_5$Cr$_3$F$_{14}$, NaCrF$_4$, K$_3$CrF$_6$, K$_2$CrF$_5$, KCrF$_4$, and K$_2$Cr$_5$F$_{17}$. These ternary compounds were first suggested by De Kozak \cite{DeKozak1969} and confirmed by structural studies \cite{de1975systeme,miranday1975croissance, sturm1962phase, garcia2014electrostatic, brunton1969crystal, le2003distorted, manaka2011effects, sassoye2006crystal} via the X-ray diffraction (XRD) method, which was summarized by Dumaire et al. \cite{dumaire2021thermodynamic}. However, thermochemical data of these compounds are scarce. Yin et al. \cite{yin2018thermodynamic, yin2015thermodynamic, yin2014thermodynamic} performed DFT calculations at 0 K to determine the formation enthalpies of Li$_3$CrF$_6$, Na$_3$CrF$_6$, Na$_5$Cr$_3$F$_{14}$, NaCrF$_4$, and KCrF$_4$. Dumaire et al. \cite{dumaire2021thermodynamic} estimated the heat capacities of these compounds based on the Neumann-Kopp rule in terms of the compositional average of heat capacity values of the corresponding compounds or elements \cite{leitner2010application}. 

%%% Modeling and First-principles details for compounds
The present work treats the compounds and endmembers in the AF-CrF${_3}$ (A=Li, Na, and K) systems as stoichiometric compounds. Thermodynamic functions of the binary endmembers are taken from the JRC database \cite{konings2020comprehensive}, JANAF tables \cite{chase1982janaf}, IVTAN tables \cite{gurvich1993ivtanthermo}, and SSUB database \cite{sgteurl}. The Gibbs energy can be expressed as 

\begin{equation} \label{ms:eq:Gstoi}
    G_m=\Delta_f H_m^0 (298.15)-T S_m^0 (298.15)+\int_{298.15}^T C_{P,m} dT - T\int_{298.15}^T \dfrac{C_{P,m}}{T} dT
\end{equation}

where $\Delta_f H_m^0 (298.15)$ is the standard formation enthalpy, $S_m^0 (298.15)$ the standard entropy at 298.15 K, and $C_{P,m}$ the heat capacity. The thermodynamic data of ternary compounds, including enthalpy, entropy, and heat capacity are obtained through DFT-based first-principles and phonon calculations (see Section \ref{method:ssec:dft}).

All DFT-based first-principles and phonon calculations in the present work were performed by the VASP \cite{kresse1996efficient} using the open-source software DFTTK \cite{wang2021dfttk}. The projector augmented-wave method (PAW) was used for electron-ion interactions to increase computational efficiency compared with the full potential methods \cite{blochl1994projector, kresse1999ultrasoft}. Electron exchange and correlation effects were described using both the local density approximation (LDA) \cite{perdew1981self} and the GGA \cite{perdew1996generalized}. In addition, the DFT+U approach was employed for 11 compounds containing Cr, i.e., CrF${_2}$, CrF${_3}$, Cr$_2$F$_5$, Li$_3$CrF$_6$, Na$_3$CrF$_6$, Na$_5$Cr$_3$F$_{14}$, NaCrF$_4$, K$_3$CrF$_6$, K$_2$CrF$_5$, KCrF$_4$, K$_2$Cr$_5$F$_{17}$. The effective U values for Cr were selected as 3.7 eV, considering 3$-$4eV was commonly used in the literature \cite{shi2009magnetism, mattsson2019density, huang2022dft}. The spin configurations were also considered for these 11 compounds containing Cr. All possible configurations by varying spin up and spin down of Cr atoms were explored by the ATAT code \cite{van2009multicomponent}. The spin configuration with the lowest energy for each Cr-containing compound was used for DFT and phonon calculations. Using DFTTK, structure information is the only required input, then robust relaxation schemes can be automatically performed to obtain equilibrium results at 0 K and thermodynamic properties at finite temperatures through the QHA. During DFTTK calculations, the plane-wave cutoff energy was set as 520 eV. Table \ref{ms:tab:DFTdetails} lists the k-points meshes for DFT-based total energy calculations, the supercell sizes and the k-points meshes for phonon calculations. The phonon DOS was analyzed using the YPHON code \cite{wang2014yphon}, which has been integrated into DFTTK \cite{wang2021dfttk}.

%%% CALPHAD modeling details
The MQMQA \cite{pelton2001modified} is used to describe the liquid phase by considering the short-range ordering (SRO) that occurs in liquid salts. Here, the model (A, Cr)(F) is introduced and hence the A$_2$F$_2$, Cr$_2$F$_2$, and ACrF$_2$ quadruplets (A=Li, Na, and K) are formed to consider the interactions among them. Coordination numbers Z describe the SNN coordination number of the species i (= Li, Na, K, Cr, or F) in quadruplets. Z of anions can be calculated to maintain charge neutrality as follows:

\begin{equation} \label{ms:eq:MQMZ}
    \dfrac{q_A}{(Z_{AB/FF}^A)}+\dfrac{q_B}{(Z_{AB/FF}^B)}=2\times \dfrac{q_F}{(Z_{AB/FF}^F)}
\end{equation}

where $q_i$ is the charges of ion $i$ (= Li, Na, K, Cr, or F). Table \ref{ms:tab:CrZ} shows the coordination numbers used in the present work.

\end{table}

The excess Gibbs energy $G^{excess}$ relates to the formation Gibbs energy of the quadruplet, $\Delta g_{quadruplet}^{ex}$, by considering the following reaction:

\begin{equation} \label{ms:eq:MQMGrea}
    \left(\rm {A_2/F_2}\right)_{quad}+\left({\rm Cr_2/F_2}\right)_{quad}=2\left({\rm ACr/F_2}\right)_{quad}\;\;\;\;\;\Delta g_{\rm ACr/F_2}^{ex}
\end{equation}

where $\Delta g_{\rm ACr/F_2}^{ex}$ represents the Gibbs energy change when forming the quadruplet and can be described by:

\begin{equation} \label{ms:eq:MQMGex}
    \Delta g_{\rm {ACr/F_2}}^{ex}=\Delta g_{\rm {ACr/F_2}}^o+\sum_{(i+j)\geq1} g_{\rm {ACr/F_2}}^{ij}\chi _{\rm {ACr/F_2}}^{i}\chi _{\rm {CrA/F_2}}^{j}
\end{equation}

where $g_{\rm {ACr/F_2}}^{ij}$ is a function of temperature and it is independent of composition. $\chi _{\rm {ACr/F_2}}^{i}$ and $\chi _{\rm {CrA/F_2}}^{j}$ are composition-dependent terms as:

\begin{equation} \label{ms:eq:chi}
    \chi_{\rm {ACr/F_2}} = \dfrac{X_{\rm {A_2/F_2}}}{X_{\rm {A_2/F_2}}+X_{\rm {ACr/F_2}}+X_{\rm {Cr_2/F_2}}}
\end{equation}

where $X_{\rm{ACr/F_2}}$ is the fractions of $\left(\rm{ACr/F_2}\right)_{quad}$ shown in (\ref{ms:eq:MQMGrea}). 

In the CrF${_2}$-CrF${_3}$ system, there are three solid solution phases, i.e., CrF${_2}$ near the Cr-rich region, CrF${_3}$ near the F-rich region, and Cr$_2$F$_5$ showing on the middle region of the CrF${_2}$-CrF${_3}$ phase diagram. The present work adopts the same models used by Dumaire et al. \cite{dumaire2021thermodynamic}, where the regular solution model with the Kohler-Toop interpolation \cite{kohler1960estimation, toop1965predicting, chartrand2000choice, pelton2001general} is used for Cr$_2$F$_5$. For solid solution phases near CrF${_2}$ and CrF${_3}$, the sublattice model is used for each phase, respectively, considering the Wyckoff positions of CrF${_2}$ and CrF${_3}$ as follows. CrF${_2}$ possesses the symmetry with space group $P2_1/c$ with two Wyckoff sites of 2a and 4e, and the sublattice model (Cr, Va)$_1$(F, Va)$_2$ is hence used with Va representing the vacancy. CrF${_3}$ phase is modeled by (Cr, Va)$_1$(F, Va)$_3$ by considering its space group $R\bar{3}c$ and the two Wyckoff sites of 2b and 6e. The Gibbs energy is formulated as:

\begin{equation} \label{ms:eq:Crssoln}
    \begin{aligned}
        G_m&=\sum_{i=Cr,Va}{\sum_{j=F,Va}{y_i^\prime y_j^{\prime\prime}}\:^oG_{i:j}}\\
        &+RT\left(\sum_{i=Cr,Va}{y_i^\prime\ln{\left(y_i^\prime\right)}}+\sum_{j=F,Va}{y_j^{\prime\prime}\ln{\left(y_j^{\prime\prime}\right)}}\right)\\&+y_{Cr}^\prime y_{Va}^\prime\left(y_F^{\prime\prime}L_{Cr,Va:F}\right)+y_F^{\prime\prime}y_{Va}^{\prime\prime}\left(y_{Cr}^\prime L_{Cr:F,Va}\right)
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}

where $y_i^{(s)}$ is the site fraction of component i on sublattice s, ${^o}G_{i:j}$ the Gibbs energy of the endmember (i:j), and $L$ the interaction parameters which can be expanded using the Redlich-Kister polynomials \cite{redlich1948algebraic}. 

Phase equilibria in the LiF-CrF${_3}$, NaF-CrF${_3}$, and KF-CrF${_3}$ binary systems were investigated by De Kozak \cite{de1975systeme, DeKozak1969} using differential thermal analysis (DTA). In LiF-CrF${_3}$, two eutectic reactions were measured, i.e., Liquid $\leftrightarrow$ LiF + Li$_3$CrF$_6$ at 1003 K and around mole fraction $x$(CrF${_3}$) = 0.15 and Liquid $\leftrightarrow$ CrF${_3}$ + Li$_3$CrF$_6$ at 1059 K and $x$(CrF${_3}$) = 0.35. In NaF-CrF${_3}$, one peritectic reaction of Liquid + CrF${_3}$ $\leftrightarrow$ NaCrF$_4$ at 1234 K and three eutectic reactions were determined, i.e., Liquid $\leftrightarrow$ NaCrF$_4$ + Na$_5$Cr$_3$F$_{14}$ at 1133 K, Liquid $\leftrightarrow$ Na$_3$CrF$_6$ + Na$_5$Cr$_3$F$_{14}$ at 1143 K, and Liquid $\leftrightarrow$ Na$_3$CrF$_6$ + NaF at 1166 K and around $x$(CrF${_3}$) = 0.123. In KF-CrF${_3}$, De Kozak \cite{de1975systeme, DeKozak1969} reported three peritectic reactions and two eutectic reactions, i.e., Liquid + CrF${_3}$ $\leftrightarrow$ K$_2$Cr$_5$F$_{17}$ at 1390 K, Liquid + K$_3$CrF$_6$ $\leftrightarrow$ K$_2$CrF$_5$ at 1133 K, and Liquid + K$_2$Cr$_5$F$_{17}$ $\leftrightarrow$ KCrF$_4$ at 1200 K, and Liquid $\leftrightarrow$ K$_3$CrF$_6$ + KF at 1115 K and around $x$(CrF${_3}$) = 0.048, and Liquid $\leftrightarrow$ K$_2$CrF$_5$ + KCrF$_4$ at 1112 K and around $x$(CrF${_3}$) = 0.45. Sturm \cite{sturm1962phase} reported phase equilibria in CrF${_2}$-CrF${_3}$ via quenching experiments and suggested one solid solution phase in CrF${_2}$-CrF${_3}$ with composition of CrF${_3}$ between 0.42 and 0.46 (near Cr$_2$F$_5$). However, the stability of this Cr$_2$F$_5$ solid solution phase was not explored in temperatures below 1023 K. The melting point of Cr$_2$F$_5$ was determined to be around 1270 K \cite{sturm1962phase}. Sturm \cite{sturm1962phase} reported one eutectic reaction, Liquid $\leftrightarrow$ CrF${_2}$ + Cr$_2$F$_5$ at 1103 K around $x$(CrF${_3}$) = 0.14, and one peritectic reaction Liquid + CrF${_3}$ $\leftrightarrow$ Cr$_2$F$_5$ at 1272 K around $x$(CrF${_3}$) = 0.29. Two solid solution phases near the endmembers CrF${_3}$ and CrF${_2}$ were identified from $x$(CrF${_3}$) = 0$-$0.01 and $x$(CrF${_3}$) = 0.90$-$1, respectively. 

Machine learning (ML) was used to estimate more phase equilibria data in terms of a graphic neural network model developed by Hong et al. \cite{hong2022melting} to predict melting points of compounds with composition as input. Melting temperatures of the present ternary compounds including Li$_3$CrF$_6$, Na$_3$CrF$_6$, Na$_5$Cr$_3$F$_{14}$, NaCrF$_4$, K$_3$CrF$_6$, K$_2$CrF$_5$, KCrF$_4$, and K$_2$Cr$_5$F$_{17}$ are estimated by this ML model \cite{hong2022melting}. 

%%%AIMD
For the liquid phase, experimental data such as mixing enthalpy are not available in the AF-CrF${_3}$ (A=Li, Na, and K) systems. Instead, Yin et al. \cite{yin2018thermodynamic, yin2015thermodynamic, yin2014thermodynamic} applied an empirical model to estimate the mixing enthalpy of liquid from the parameters of ions such as ionic radius. In the present work, AIMD simulations (see Section \ref{method:ssec:AIMD}) were performed to obtain the mixing enthalpy of liquid by VASP \cite{kresse1996efficient}. The supercells containing 108 or 128 atoms with periodic boundaries were used for at least six different compositions in the AF-CrF${_3}$ (A= Li, Na, and K) systems, including A$_{64}$F$_{64}$, A$_{42}$Cr$_6$F$_{60}$, A$_{36}$Cr$_9$F$_{63}$, A$_{32}$Cr$_{16}$F$_{80}$, A$_{18}$Cr$_{18}$F$_{72}$, A$_{16}$Cr$_{24}$F$_{88}$, A$_{10}$Cr$_{22}$F$_{76}$, and Cr$_{32}$F$_{96}$ (A=Li, Na, and K). The NVT canonical ensemble (i.e., the fixed number of atoms N, volume V, and temperature T) with a Nosé thermostat for temperature control \cite{nose1984unified} was employed in the present work. The temperature for each supercell was set as 1700 K, which is above all the temperatures of liquidus in the AF-CrF${_3}$ (A= Li, Na, and K) systems. A single $\Gamma$ point $1\times1\times1$ was used as the k-point mesh, together with a 400 eV cutoff energy. During AIMD simulations, Newton’s equation of motion was solved via the Verlet algorithm with a time step of 2 fs, and each calculation is run for 10,000 steps to reach thermal equilibrium.

%%%CALPHAD modeling
Thermodynamic modeling of the (LiF, NaF, KF, CrF${_2}$)-CrF${_3}$ system was carried out using the open-source software ESPEI \cite{bocklund2019espei} and PyCalphad \cite{otis2017pycalphad} with the newly implemented MQMQA \cite{palma2023thermodynamic}. All model parameters were simultaneously optimized through the Bayesian approach using MCMC \cite{bocklund2019espei}. The input data were primarily experimental phase equilibrium data including two or more co-existing phases. For stochiometric compounds, their thermochemical data from DFT-based calculations were also used as input. For the liquid phase, its mixing enthalpy from AIMD calculations was used as input for refining model parameters. In the present work, each model parameter employed two Markov chains with a standard derivation of 0.1 when initializing its Gaussian distribution. During the modeling process, the chain values can be tracked and the MCMC processes were performed until the model parameters converged.

\subsection{Thermodynamic properties in (LiF, NaF, KF, CrF$_2$)-CrF$_3$ by first-principles calculations} \label{moltensalts:ssec:FLiNaKCrsolids}

Table \ref{ms:tab:CrEOS} shows the predicted equilibrium properties of V$_0$, B$_0$, and B$^\prime$ by the EOS E-V fitting at 0 K in comparison with experimental bulk moduli \cite{yagi1978experimental, haussuhl1960thermo, boehler1980thermal, rao1974anderson, bensch1972third, jorgensen2004compression}. The B$_0$ results from GGA show a good agreement with experimental measurements. For the LiF compound, GGA predicts B$_0$ = 67.6 GPa and B$^\prime$ = 4.17, aligning well with the measured values of 65.4 GPa and 4.98 by Boehler et al. \cite{boehler1980thermal}. In comparison with the three measured B$_0$ values of 66.5 GPa by Yagi \cite{yagi1978experimental}, 76.9 GPa by Haussühl \cite{haussuhl1960thermo}, and 65.4 GPa by Boehler et al. \cite{boehler1980thermal}, the B$_0$ result by GGA shows a mean absolute error (MAE) of 4.2 GPa, while LDA predicts B$_0$ = 86.5 GPa with a higher MAE of 16.9 GPa. Considering the NaF compound, GGA predicts B$_0$ = 45.0 GPa, matching with the measured 45.9 GPa by Yagi \cite{yagi1978experimental} but lower than the measured values of 53.8 GPa by Haussühl \cite{haussuhl1960thermo}, 52.3 GPa by Rao \cite{rao1974anderson}, and 48.2 GPa by Bensch et al. \cite{bensch1972third} with the MAE around 5 GPa. On the other hand, LDA predicts B$_0$ = 61.4 GPa, which is higher than the experimental B$_0$ \cite{yagi1978experimental, haussuhl1960thermo, rao1974anderson, bensch1972third} with MAE = 11.4 GPa. Additionally, for the B$^\prime$ values of NaF, LDA predicts B$^\prime$ = 4.74, which is higher than the predicted 4.60 by GGA and closer to 5.89 reported by Bensch et al. \cite{bensch1972third}. Regarding the KF compound, the measured B$_0$ values (37.0 GPa by Yagi \cite{yagi1978experimental} and 35.5 GPa by Haussühl \cite{haussuhl1960thermo}) fall between the LDA result of 43.5 GPa and the GGA result of 28.9 GPa. The MAE value of LDA with respect to the measured B$_0$ values is 7.25 GPa, slightly lower than MAE = 7.35 GPa by GGA. As for the CrF$_3$ compound, GGA+U reports B$_0$ = 29.3 GPa, showing a 0.3\% difference compared to 29.2 GPa measured by Jørgensen et al. \cite{jorgensen2004compression}. LDA+U predicts B$_0$ = 46.2 GPa, which is 58\% higher than the measured 29.2 GPa \cite{jorgensen2004compression}. The present results indicate that LDA predicts smaller V$_0$ and higher B$_0$ values than those from GGA. It is consistent with the previous observations that LDA tends to underestimate lattice constants and overestimate cohesive energy with respect to GGA \cite{haas2009calculation, he2014accuracy}.

Figure \ref{ms:fig:FLiNaKCrphonon} compares the phonon DOS of LiF, NaF, and KF obtained using LDA and GGA in comparison with direct measurements by neutron scattering \cite{dolling1968lattice, buhrer1970lattice} or fittings in terms of measurements \cite{karo1969lattice}. Overall, the peak positions of the experimental phonon DOS are well reproduced by both LDA and GGA. However, in the low-frequency region (e.g., < 5 THz for LiF and NaF, and < 3 THz for KF), the phonon DOS predicted by LDA show a better match in both the shape and the peak position with respect to experimental data \cite{dolling1968lattice, buhrer1970lattice, karo1969lattice} than those from GGA. This observation suggests that LDA predicts more reliable thermodynamic properties of LiF, NaF, and KF when employing the phonon-based QHA since these properties are mainly regulated by phonon DOS at low-frequency regions \cite{shang2019achieving}.

Figure \ref{ms:fig:FLiNaKCr-Benchmark} illustrates a comparison of the predicted heat capacity (C$_p$), entropy (S), and enthalpy (H$-$H$_{300}$) of LiF, NaF, and KF in terms of the phonon-based QHA, where the DFT calculations were conducted using both the LDA and GGA, and the predicted results are compared to the data from the SSUB database \cite{sgteurl}. In general, thermodynamic properties predicted by LDA align well with the results from SSUB. The most substantial difference between LDA and SSUB is the C$_p$ values of KF, where a 6\% disparity is noted. Furthermore, these comparisons reveal that the LDA results exhibit a better agreement with SSUB than the GGA results, particularly for LiF. For example, at 1100 K, the C$_p$ values predicted by LDA demonstrate only a 2\% difference compared to those from the SSUB \cite{sgteurl}, whereas an 18\% difference is observed when using GGA. Figure \ref{ms:fig:FLiNaKCr-Benchmark} indicates that the QHA in terms of LDA yields more reliable predictions of thermodynamic properties in LiF-NaF-KF-based system, agreeing with the observations in phonon DOS in Figure \ref{ms:fig:FLiNaKCrphonon}. Subsequent DFT calculations were hence performed using the LDA approach.

Figure \ref{ms:fig:FLiNaKCr-Benchmark-Cr} shows the present DFT predictions and the values in SSUB \cite{sgteurl} regarding C$_p$, S, and H$-$H$_{300}$ for CrF$_3$ and CrF$_2$. In general, the present predictions tend to be lower than those obtained from SSUB \cite{sgteurl}. For CrF$_3$, the DFT predicted C$_p$ = 19.77 J/mol-atom-K closely aligns with the SSUB value of 19.73 J/mol-atom-K at 300 K. As the temperature increases to 1300 K, the difference increases to 9\%. Similarly, for CrF$_2$, the C$_p$ = 21.22 J/mol-atom-K at 300 K by DFT is in good agreement with the value of 21.66 from SSUB. At a higher temperature of 1140 K, the difference expands to 12\%. Regarding entropy, DFT predicts lower S values for both CrF$_3$ and CrF$_2$ than those in SSUB across the temperature range shown in Figure \ref{ms:fig:FLiNaKCr-Benchmark-Cr}. At high temperatures (e.g., 1600 K for CrF$_3$ and 1140 K for CrF$_2$), it shows a 10\% difference in CrF$_3$ and 14\% in CrF$_2$. It is found that a good agreement is observed regarding H$-$H$_{300}$ values of CrF$_3$ and CrF$_2$ between the DFT calculations and the SSUB at lower temperatures (< 1000 K for CrF$_3$ and < 600 K for CrF$_2$). H$-$H$_{300}$ from DFT becomes slightly lower than that in SSUB \cite{sgteurl} with increasing temperature, with the differences, for example, around 5\% in CrF$_3$ at 1650 K and 9\% in CrF$_2$ at 1140 K.

Table \ref{ms:tab:FLiNaK-Cr-Hf} shows the present DFT values of formation enthalpy ($\Delta_fH_m$) of these ternary compounds using the LDA+U approach, together with the reactions to form these compounds. Table \ref{ms:tab:FLiNaK-Cr-Hf} shows that the $\Delta_fH_m$ values are negative for all ternary compounds with reference to their corresponding binary compounds. Yin et al. \cite{yin2018thermodynamic, yin2014thermodynamic} conducted DFT calculations for Li3CrF6 and Na3CrF6. Predicted $\Delta_fH_m$ values from the Materials Project \cite{jain2013commentary} and the Open Quantum Materials Database (OQMD) \cite{kirklin2015open} are also listed in Table \ref{ms:tab:FLiNaK-Cr-Hf} and displayed in Figure \ref{ms:fig:FLiNaKCr-Hf}. The present DFT calculations by LDA+U predict higher $\Delta_fH_m$ values of Li3CrF6 and Na3CrF6 than those by Yin et al. \cite{yin2018thermodynamic, yin2014thermodynamic} using GGA. The present DFT calculations align better with results from the Materials Project \cite{jain2013commentary} and OQMD \cite{kirklin2015open} than calculations from Yin et al. \cite{yin2018thermodynamic, yin2014thermodynamic}. Figure \ref{ms:fig:FLiNaKCr-Hf} displays the convex hulls for the LiF-CrF$_3$, NaF-CrF$_3$, and KF-CrF$_3$ systems based on the $\Delta_fH_m$ values listed in Table \ref{ms:tab:FLiNaK-Cr-Hf}. These convex hulls serve as indicators regarding the stability of ternary compounds in these systems. Li3CrF6 is on the convex hull, suggesting that it is stable in the LiF-CrF$_3$ system. In the NaF-CrF$_3$ system, Na3CrF6 is located on the hull, indicating its stability at 0 K. Na5Cr3F14 shows an elevation of 1.09 kJ/mol-atom above the hull, and NaCrF4 shows 0.42 kJ/mol-atom above the hull. In the KF-CrF$_3$ system, K2CrF5 is on the convex hull at 0 K. K2Cr5F17 is the farthest away from the convex hull (1.31 kJ/mol-atom above it), while K3CrF6 and KCrF4 are 0.62 kJ/mol-atom and 0.61 kJ/mol-atom above the hull, respectively. These calculations at 0 K suggest that Na5Cr3F14, NaCrF4, K2Cr5F17, K3CrF6, and KCrF4 are not stable at 0 K, while De Kozak \cite{DeKozak1969} reported the existence of the above ternary compounds at high temperature. It suggests that phonon-based QHA is necessary to investigate the thermodynamic properties of ternary compounds at high temperatures.
